        <center><h1>Help Change Lives by Teaching to Code</h1></center>
            <h4>For girls in their final years of schooling in India’s heartland, learning coding can be the difference between a life where choices are thrust upon them and an opportunity to make choices, achieve financial independence for their families, and control their destinies.</h4>

            <h1>Learn real-world skills through classroom leadership</h1>

               <h4>Learn leadership, master management skills, accumulate life-defining experiences, and build your tribe for a purposeful life and career by facilitating learning and managing classrooms at a rural low-income school.</h4>
               <h1>Build (an education movement) for Bharat</h1>
               <h4>
                The Code India Fellowship is an opportunity to understand grassroots challenges in rural India (with a focus on education) and to be a part of and build a movement to make education meaningful and rewarding for India’s children.</h4>

                <h4>The problem<br>
                   Our education system is fundamentally unequal, and it does not provide students from marginalized communities access to possibilities that students from the top of the pyramid take for granted. The school education system catering to most parts of rural India does not even try to empower the recipient with an opportunity to access aspirational careers. With the current schooling they can access, girls from underprivileged backgrounds cannot dream of financial independence or agency over their own lives and often have stifling life decisions made for them.
                    
                    We need a profound transformation of the education system for our students so they can aspire to hold the same jobs and live a life of similar possibilities as students from the top of the pyramid. An equitable higher education alternative where students learn the right skills, mindsets, and the ability to learn on their own to thrive in the world can be built.</h4>

                    <h1>What’s Code India Fellowship</h1>
                        <h4>Code India Fellowship is a high-impact ambitious program to onboard high-aptitude and mission-aligned young tech graduates for a one-year fellowship. The fellows will be placed in government high schools to transform the learning and life outcomes of students from classes 8 to 12 in these schools.
                        
                        The core responsibility of the fellows would be to facilitate learning for the students (focused on young women) at their schools. Additionally, the fellows can take up other responsibilities, including coding projects & program management.
                        <h4>In India, where girls are married as soon as they are 18, Code India Fellowship aims to enable young women to have jobs or admission to advanced training opportunities by the time they finish their school education.

                            Post-program, the fellows will join a cadre of young, high-aptitude technology leaders solving for education access and other social issues through technology & other mediums.</h4>
